## 📖 Project Overview

**PurePlate** is a mobile application that helps users **track their daily calorie intake** and receive **personalized recipe suggestions** based on:
- Remaining calorie budget  
- Available ingredients  
- Preferred preparation time  

With its **dynamic calorie visualization ring**, users receive instant visual feedback about how each recipe fits within their calorie goals — making healthy eating easier, faster, and waste-free.

---

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

### ❌ The Problem
In today’s fast-paced world, individuals struggle to:
- Find recipes that match their **nutritional goals**,  
- Fit their **limited time**, and  
- Utilize **ingredients they already have** at home.  

This often leads to wasted food, time, and failed diet adherence.

### ✅ The Solution
**PurePlate** combines **three essential filters** — calories, time, and ingredients — to provide recipes that perfectly fit user constraints.  
It dynamically visualizes calorie usage, helping users stay on track while minimizing waste and cooking effort.

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🔹 1. Calorie Tracking
Users can log daily meals and their estimated calorie values.

### 🔹 2. Dynamic Calorie Visualization Ring (NEW)
A circular progress ring visually displays:
- Remaining daily calorie budget  
- Instant feedback on how much each suggested recipe will “fill up” that budget

### 🔹 3. Calorie-Based Recipe Suggestions
Recommends recipes that stay within or below the remaining daily calorie limit.

### 🔹 4. Time-Based Filtering
Users can set a **maximum preparation time** (e.g., 10, 20 minutes) for fast, efficient meal options.

### 🔹 5. Ingredient-Based Filtering
Select ingredients currently available (e.g., chicken, rice, eggs) and receive recipes using those items only.

## 🌟 Nice-to-Have Features (Future Enhancements)

- **Recipe Modifier:** Adjust portion size and substitute ingredients with automatic calorie recalculation.  
- **Quick Log from History:** Instantly log calories from previously cooked/saved recipes.  
- **Preference Learning:** Prioritize favorite ingredients/categories without ML (score-based system).  
- **Meal Scheduling & Reminders:** Plan meals and receive notifications.  
- **Pantry Score Gamification:** Earn badges and scores for minimizing food waste.  
- **Photo Ingredient Recognition (Optional):** Detect fridge/pantry ingredients using photos.

## 💾 Platform & Data Storage

### 🧩 Platform
- Developed with **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile deployment (Android & iOS).

### 🗄️ Data Storage
Using **Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)** to store:
| Data Type | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **User Profiles** | Credentials, dietary preferences, allergies, and cuisine choices. |
| **Calorie Logs** | Daily meal and calorie data for computing remaining intake. |
| **Recipe Catalog** | Recipe name, steps, calories, prep time, and ingredients. |
| **User History** | Favorite, tried, or rated recipes for personalization. |

## ⚠️ Potential Challenges

1. **Recipe-Ingredient-Calorie Alignment:** Building a consistent dataset that accurately links ingredients, calories, and cooking time.  
2. **User Input Normalization:** Handling diverse formats like “1 handful of nuts” or “100g chicken.”  
3. **Efficient Filtering Logic:** Designing algorithms that handle calorie/time/ingredient filtering fast and efficiently.  
4. **Preference Tracking (Non-ML):** Creating an effective scoring-based personalization system.

---

## 💎 Unique Selling Point (USP)

PurePlate stands out by combining **three simultaneous filters**:
1. **Calorie Goal**  
2. **Time Limit**  
3. **Available Ingredients**

While other recipe apps typically focus on only one or two of these, PurePlate delivers **a real-time, dynamic, and personalized recommendation** system.  

Combined with its **Calorie Visualization Ring**, it uniquely helps users stay mindful of health goals while minimizing waste — **without needing heavy AI or ML models**.
